# Daily-Checklist
A daily checklist built with a node backend and single file frontend.
The server.js is meant to run on a node server, with required dependencies in the package.json
You should note, the sample urls in the frontend HTML should be changed to the backend endpoints.
Same goes for the env variable for the port in server.js
